# Evaluation Semantics

The tree-walking interpreter in `grasm_interp` is the **reference
implementation**: where the native backend and the interpreter disagree, the
interpreter is right and the backend has a bug. `scripts/difftest.sh` enforces
this on every program in the repository.

## 1. Values

**[E-VALUE-SEMANTICS]** All values have value semantics. Assigning, passing,
or storing a value never creates an alias: mutating one binding cannot be
observed through another.

**[E-COW]** Value semantics are implemented with copy-on-write, so a copy costs
a reference-count bump and an actual copy happens only on mutation of a shared
value. This is an optimization and never observable.

## 2. Evaluation order

**[E-ORDER-LTR]** Subexpressions evaluate left to right. Function arguments
evaluate left to right before the call.

**[E-SHORTCIRCUIT]** `and` does not evaluate its right operand when the left is
`false`; `or` does not when the left is `true`.

**[E-CLOSURE-CAPTURE]** A closure captures the values it uses **at the moment
it is created**, not the bindings. Changing a captured variable afterwards is
not visible inside, and a closure may not write to one at all — that is a
compile error ([T-CAPTURE-WRITE]), because the write would change a copy the
caller can never see.

This is the same value semantics every other binding has ([E-COW]), applied to
a closure's environment. It has one consequence worth stating outright, because
it is the shape of program people reach for first: **an effect handler cannot
hold mutable state.** A handler's operations are closures, so a `Store` whose
`write` updates a captured list updates a copy, and the next `read` does not
see it. Handlers are for supplying values and for accepting output; state that
has to change belongs in the caller, threaded through `inout` or returned.

Note the contrast with **[E-SPAWN-SHARED]**: a `spawn` body *does* see and
mutate the enclosing scope. Two block-shaped constructs, two rules.

**[E-COALESCE-LAZY]** `a ?? b` evaluates `b` only when `a` is `None`.

## 3. Arithmetic

**[E-ARITH-INT]** `+ - *` on `i64` wrap on overflow (two's complement), and
so does `/`: `i64::MIN / -1` has no representable result and yields `i64::MIN`
rather than trapping. `i64::MIN % -1` is `0`, as `x % -1` is for every `x`.

**[E-DIV-ZERO]** Integer `/` or `%` by zero panics.

**[E-POW-NEG]** A negative integer exponent panics; use floats.

**[E-RECURSION-DEPTH]** Recursion is bounded. **At least 10,000 nested calls
are guaranteed to work.** Past an implementation's own bound the program
panics with a stack-overflow message and exit 101 — it does not abort, crash,
or corrupt the process. The bound above the guaranteed minimum is
implementation-defined and differs between the two engines, so a program that
recurses deeper than 10,000 should not assume it will run everywhere.

**[E-ARITH-FLOAT]** Float arithmetic follows IEEE-754, including infinities and
NaN. Division by zero yields an infinity rather than panicking.

**[E-NUM-PROMOTE]** Mixing `i64` and `f64` in one operation promotes to `f64`.

**[E-STR-CONCAT]** `+` on two `str` values concatenates them.

**[E-STR-COMPARE]** `< <= > >=` on `str` compare lexicographically by code
point.

**[E-EQ-STRUCTURAL]** `==` compares structurally and recursively; two values of
the same shape and contents are equal.

## 4. Collections

**[E-INDEX-BOUNDS]** Indexing a list out of bounds panics with the index and
the length. `list.get(i)` returns `Option` instead of panicking.

**[E-MAP-ORDER]** Map iteration (`keys`, `values`, printing) is in sorted key
order — `false` before `true`, then integers ascending, then strings
lexicographically — so program output is deterministic.

**[E-STR-CHARS]** String length and indexing operate on Unicode characters,
not bytes.

**[E-PAD-CYCLE]** `pad_start` / `pad_end` widen a string to a character count
using a fill that repeats cyclically and is cut to the exact width. A string
already at or over the width is returned unchanged; an empty fill panics.

**[E-SEARCH-SHORTCIRCUIT]** `any` and `find` stop at the first element whose
predicate holds; `all` stops at the first that fails. Elements after the
deciding one are never passed to the predicate.

**[E-MINMAX-OPTION]** `min` / `max` return `Option`: `None` on an empty list,
so an empty list is not a panic and not a sentinel value.

## 5. Control flow

**[E-IF-VALUE]** `if` is an expression when both branches yield the same type;
otherwise it is a statement of type `()`.

**[E-MATCH-ORDER]** Match arms are tried top to bottom; the first whose pattern
matches and whose guard passes is taken.

**[E-LOOP-RANGE]** `for i in a..b` iterates `a` up to but excluding `b`;
`a..=b` includes `b`. An empty range runs zero times.

**[E-LOOP-LIST]** `for x in xs` iterates a list's elements directly, in order.
The loop variable is the element, not its index. Iterating an empty list runs
zero times.

## 6. Errors and panics

**[E-ERR-PROPAGATE]** `try` on `Err(e)` returns `Err(e)` from the enclosing
function immediately, skipping the rest of its body.

**[E-PANIC-EXIT]** A panic prints `panic: <message>` and exits with status
101. It is a program bug, not a recoverable condition.

**[E-MAIN-ERR]** An error reaching `main` prints
`error: unhandled error from main: <value>` and exits with status 1.

## 7. Effects

**[E-HANDLER-INNERMOST]** An effect operation dispatches to the innermost
enclosing handler for that effect.

**[E-HANDLER-SCOPE]** A handler is installed for the dynamic extent of its
`with` block, including calls made from inside it.

**[E-HANDLER-MISSING]** A user effect that reaches `main` or a test without a
handler is rejected *at compile time*, so the runtime's missing-handler panic is
a defensive backstop that well-typed programs never reach.

## 8. Concurrency

**[E-PARALLEL-JOIN]** A `parallel` block does not exit until every task spawned
inside it has completed.

**[E-SPAWN-ORDER]** Tasks run to completion in the order they were spawned.
This is deterministic: the same program always produces the same output.

**[E-SPAWN-SHARED]** A task body sees the enclosing scope, which is how tasks
share results. This is the opposite of how a closure body behaves — see
**[E-CLOSURE-CAPTURE]** — and the two are worth reading together, because
`spawn { … }` and `|x| { … }` look alike and do not capture alike.

**[E-TASK-PANIC]** A panicking task aborts the whole scope; tasks spawned after
it do not run.

**[E-NOT-PARALLEL]** `parallel`/`spawn` tasks are *not* executed on multiple
cores. That scope provides structure and determinism, not speedup — tasks share
the enclosing scope, and running them concurrently would race. Multi-core
execution of *data* is provided by `par_map` instead.

**[E-PAR-FILTER-ORDER]** `xs.par_filter(f)` tests elements concurrently and
keeps the survivors in **input order**. The predicate parallelises; the
compaction that follows does not, so the result does not depend on how many
cores ran it.

**[E-PAR-MAP-ORDER]** `xs.par_map(f)` applies `f` to every element, possibly on
several cores, and returns the results in **input order**. The result does not
depend on how many cores ran it — including one — so a `par_map` is
interchangeable with a `map` in every observable way.

## 9. Ownership at runtime

**[E-INOUT-WRITEBACK]** Mutations to an `inout` parameter are visible to the
caller when the function returns.

**[E-OWN-RUNTIME]** `own` has no runtime effect beyond an ordinary pass; the
guarantee it provides is entirely static.

## 10. Testing

**[E-TEST-PROPERTY]** A property test runs its body once per generated case.
It passes only if every case holds; the first failing case ends the run.

**[E-TEST-SHRINK]** A failing property is reported with a *shrunk*
counterexample: the runner repeatedly substitutes smaller inputs and keeps any
that still fail, so the reported values are minimal rather than whatever the
generator happened to produce.

**[E-TEST-SEED]** Generation is driven entirely by a seed. The same seed and
case count reproduce the same run exactly, and a failure reports the seed that
found it.

**[E-BENCH-WARMUP]** A benchmark body runs once before timing starts. A body
that panics is reported as a failure instead of a measurement.

## 11. Program startup

**[E-ENTRY]** Execution begins at `main` in the entry module. A program
without `main` is an error.

**[E-ARGS]** `args()` returns the arguments the program was given, excluding
the program's own name. How they are given depends on how the program is run,
and the `--` in `grasm run prog.gr -- a b` belongs to the toolchain rather
than to the program: it separates the toolchain's arguments from the
program's. A compiled binary has no such separator, so `./prog a b` passes the
same two arguments. In every mode `args()` sees `[a, b]`, and a literal `--`
among a program's arguments is an ordinary argument.
